## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in analyzing Bangkok Airbnb datasets of real estate (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ )  and using my analytical skills to find the most suitable lodging option for my family in Bangkok.

We are required to complete the following main tasks:

1) Strategies for searching for my family's best accommodation in Bangkok: Factors to consider and price analysis.

2) Investigating the average price trend for Airbnb properties in Bangkok over 2023 according to the dataset - calendar to ascertain some patterns. Compare this trend with the selected housing location for the family.

3) Investigating the trend of the number of reviews for Airbnb properties in Bangkok over time to ascertain any recognizable patterns or changes.

In addition, we should:

1) Evaluate the quantity of accommodation offered in Bangkok categorized by their respective districts.

2) Examine the mean prices of hotels based on evaluations provided by tourists.

3) Investigate a potential relationship between various characteristics.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
